A minimalist and elegant web application for translating documents to and from Indonesian while preserving formatting.

LuminaTranslate is a visually stunning web application designed for seamless document translation between English and Indonesian. The core focus is on user experience and preserving the original document's formatting. The application features a clean, single-page interface where users can effortlessly upload documents via a drag-and-drop zone. The UI provides clear feedback through various states: idle, uploading, processing, success, and error, all enhanced with subtle micro-interactions and animations.

The backend is a mock API endpoint on a Cloudflare Worker, simulating the translation process to allow for a fully interactive and demoable frontend. This mock backend mimics the behavior of processing a document and returning a link to the translated version, paving the way for future integration with a real translation engine.

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/luminatranslate.git
    cd luminatranslate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

The application is designed to be intuitive and straightforward:

1.  **Upload a Document:** Drag and drop your file (`.docx`, `.txt`, etc.) onto the designated area, or click the area to open a file browser.
2.  **Select Translation Direction:** Use the toggle to choose the source and target languages (e.g., English to Indonesian).

4.  **Download:** Once complete, a "Download" button will appear. Click it to get your translated file.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The codebase is organized into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application, including pages, components, hooks, and styles.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code, built with Hono. This is where API routes and logic reside.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces that are shared between the frontend and backend to ensure type safety.
